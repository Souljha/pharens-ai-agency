## ðŸŽ¨ Customization Options

### Adjust Auto-Call Timing
In `src/lib/components/Contact.svelte`, line 45-47:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  triggerAutoCall();
}, 2000); // Change this value (milliseconds)
```

### Customize Call Interface
Edit `src/lib/components/VoiceAgent.svelte`:
- Button styles and colors
- Layout and spacing
- Icons and animations
- Status messages

### Modify Service Card
Edit `src/lib/components/Services.svelte`, lines 149-199:
- Service description
- Feature list
- Call-to-action text

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

Track these metrics in your Vapi dashboard:
- Total calls per month per client
- Call duration averages
- Call completion rates
- User satisfaction (if configured)
- Peak call times

## ðŸ’° Cost Management

Based on your tiered model:

| Tier | Monthly Calls | Your Cost | Client Price | Profit Margin |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Starter | 100 | $35 | $99 | ~65% |
| Pro | 500 | $150 | $299 | ~50% |
| Enterprise | 2000 | $600 | $999 | ~40% |

**Tips:**
- Set up usage alerts in Vapi dashboard
- Monitor which clients approach their limits
- Consider overage pricing for extra calls
- Track ROI per tier to optimize pricing

### Architecture

```
User Flow:

4. Call automatically initiates
5. User interacts with AI via voice

OR

1. User clicks "Talk to Our AI Agent"
2. VoiceAgent interface appears
3. User starts call manually
4. Voice conversation begins
```

### State Management

Voice call state is managed in `src/lib/stores/ui.js`:
- `voiceCallActive` - Boolean for active call
- `voiceCallStatus` - 'idle' | 'connecting' | 'active' | 'ending'
- `voiceCallDuration` - Call duration in seconds
- `voiceCallMuted` - Mute status
- `voiceCallError` - Error messages

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Must start with `PUBLIC_` to be accessible in the browser
2. **Microphone Permission**: Users must grant microphone access for calls to work
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Mobile Support**: Fully responsive, works on mobile devices
